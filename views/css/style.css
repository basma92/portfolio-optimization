You can increase your sites performance with hardware accelerated CSS. The GPU can be trigger by simply including the transform: translateZ(0); declaration. Furthermore, adding the backface-visibility property with the hidden value can make a huge difference in no so powerful equipments as it enables hardware acceleration.
Both properties should be applied on this class selector.

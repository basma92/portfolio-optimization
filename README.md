## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project
# steps to make the pagespeed score more than 90 in main.html
[i have used this site]( https://gtmetrix.com/) and followed the steps 
1.scaled the pizzeria image
2.optimized the profile and pizzaria images
3.added the media attribute "print" to the print css style sheet
4.put the javacscripts at the end of the page
5.add the async attribute tojs
9.specify image dimensions 
10.minified js and print.css
11.inline javascript
## steps to acheive the 60 fps
i have followed the webcasts
1.i have replaced allthe"query selector" with getElementBy "id or class name " as it is faster
2.in the updatePositions() ,i mhave moved the"document.body.scrollTop / 1250"out of the for loop,so itis done once then called inside the loop
3.in the event listener "scroll" i have moved the "document.getElementById("movingPizzas1")" out side the for loop to call it once not at each loop itteration 
4.i reduced the number of pizzas to 50 instead of 200 not to take that time 
5.

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository and inspect the code.

### Getting started

#### Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to the top-level of your project directory to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ./ngrok http 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! Optional: [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

#### Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
